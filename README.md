# React-Resume
 
 #Brief Summary
While on the web I stumbled on [Brittany Chiang](https://www.brittanychiang.com "Brittany's Homepage"). As one who aspires to get better at web development, I was inspired by her personal web page and eventually made my way to her GitHub page where I found [This project](https://github.com/bchiang7/react-profile)

This was a seemingly simple react based web Resume, originally following [This tutorial](https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/building-your-first-react-js-app-d53b0c98dc#.1439cdewq) .Brittany however took it to the next level and made [this](https://github.com/bchiang7/react-profile). in an attempt to better familiarize myself with React, I cloned her repository and went through the lines of code and refactored it to what we have here!

I do not claim this to be directly my work, there have been slight alterations from the original, but this ended up being a fun dive into ReactJS!
